This web application uses a database that is based off of https://strategywiki.org/wiki/MapleStory/Spell_Trace_and_Star_Force#Stats_Boost

The application takes in the stats of equipment and tells you what stats it will have at a certain star so you can determine if the stats are worth the risk of destroying your equipment.

#How to use:
1) Put in the desired star from 0-25
2) Put in the level of the item 0-200
3) Put in the base stats and atk of the item
4) Hit submit
